# automations-and-integrations

> **Reference Only / Community-Maintained** — This repository is not an official Cognition AI product. It is a community-contributed collection of sample automations and integration patterns maintained by the [Devin-Samples](https://github.com/Devin-Samples) organization. It is not supported, endorsed, or guaranteed by Cognition AI's core engineering team.

Sample workflows, webhook receivers, pipeline templates, network connectivity patterns, and deployable infrastructure for integrating [Devin](https://devin.ai) into your software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Disclaimer

**This repository contains reference implementations provided "as is".** These samples are intended as starting points — not production-ready solutions. Specifically:

- **No stability guarantees.** Samples may change without notice as the Devin API evolves.
- **No official support.** For issues with these samples, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Devin-Samples/automations-and-integrations/issues). For issues with the Devin API itself, contact [support@cognition.ai](mailto:support@cognition.ai).
- **Not production-hardened.** If you deploy these integrations, you do so at your own risk. Thoroughly test, review, and validate for your environment before use.
- **Security is your responsibility.** These samples demonstrate patterns — you must implement proper secret management, access controls, and input validation for your deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Devin account with API access ([Teams quickstart](https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/getting-started/teams-quickstart) or [Enterprise quickstart](https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/getting-started/enterprise-quickstart))
- A Devin API key (created via a service user in your organization settings)

### Quick Start

1. Browse the category directory for the integration you need
2. Follow the README in the specific platform directory for setup instructions
3. Configure your Devin API key and any required credentials
4. Customize the sample to fit your workflow

**New to private network access?** Start with the [Network Connectivity decision guide](network-connectivity/) to find the right pattern for your cloud provider and use case.
